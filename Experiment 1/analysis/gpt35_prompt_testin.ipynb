Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:\\n\\n- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.\\n- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.\\n\\nQuestions:\\n1. Please choose an option:\\n- Proposal A\\n- Proposal B\\n2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:\\n- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A\\n- 2: Preference for Proposal A\\n- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A\\n- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B\\n- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B\\n- 6: Preference for Proposal B\\n- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B\\n3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:\\n\\nProvide your response as a JSON object. As an example: '{\"Q1_Response\": \"Your Proposal Choice\", \"Q2_Response\": \"Your Rating\", \"Q3_Response\": \"Your Rationale.\"}'.\\n\\nResponse:                                                                                              40\n",
