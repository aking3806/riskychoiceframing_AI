Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:

Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.

",Proposal B,7,"My preference for Proposal B is based on the fact that there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared. This means that there is a chance for the grove of ancient oak trees to be fully preserved. Although there is a 2/3 probability that all 900 trees will be cleared, the potential for complete preservation outweighs the risk. Additionally, the severity of the threat from deforestation justifies taking this chance to save the grove."
