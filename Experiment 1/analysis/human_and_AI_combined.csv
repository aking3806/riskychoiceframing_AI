Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A

- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the marine animals will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will survive, and 2/3 probability that no marine animals will survive.

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A

Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal.

Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A

- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B

Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A

Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the marine animals will die.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no marine animals will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the marine animals will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:
