1,I'm not good with maths and I don't like gambling. 1/3 guaranteed alive animals is better than the 2/3 gamble that all of them die.
3,I love me a good gamble. Best feeling in the world if you win. :)

13,No room for error
15,I looked at the odds of all the trees being removed vs some remaining. While u would prefer less trees be removed i thought it would be less likely to happen
18,"Now take the risk for B, even if it succeeds, 1/3 of the animals will perish, so be sure about choosing A"
20,"Life is bigger than days, there is a 1/3 chance to save everyone, and as government officials should mobilize all available resources to save more lives   "
21,Both of them are really bad choices so I cannot have a preference 
24,Maybe fewer people will die this way
25,A 1/3 chance
28," If you bet right, you can avoid ocean death."

33,Preference refers to a concept in utility theory. It refers to the attitude of decision makers towards returns and risks. The degree to which the decision-maker has a strong preference for an option or outcome

38,find oneself
40,"While both policies, on average, result in the same number of deaths, a straight reduction of deaths makes more sense for a one-time implementation of policy."
42,The risk of Plan A is lower

57,"A chance no-one will die is still better than a certainty that some will die, I want to hope for the best outcome."
58,good
60,"Plan A is death, Plan B is possible survival, since it is possible, why not try Plan B"
61,It fits my idea
78,I wouldnt want to risk loosing all of the animals. Saving at least 300 is good enough for me
80,"Satisfied at the moment, I also really want not a single tree to be cut down, but no matter what I try, if I don’t succeed, then 900 trees will be cut down, so I prefer plan A"
83,Y

87,preference for proposal
88,Plan A can ensure at least 300 trees to live.
89,risk seeking for loss
93,概率的生还，是值得去拼搏的
94,"I can't make the decision of death for others, but I should be stable to let more people live"
95,"Minimizing the mortality of Marine organisms is A good plan to maintain the ecology. If B is chosen, there will be a greater probability of causing the death of more Marine organisms, which is obvious, so I choose A"
97,Many animals will be saved than B
98,Slight outcome of less treees being logged
100,at least people still have a chance to survive
103,
104,Because we still have to leave some trees for them to grow.
106,none
107,The risks of Plan B are large and unbearable
110,Probability problem B is so small that if you choose A you will at least keep the trees and if you choose B the trees will almost always be cut down
117,
123,Many will survive
125,
128,emm
131,
132,
134,For sure save the marine animals
135,
136,Option B is more likely to have more trees cut down.
138,Scheme A has a high probability and the least danger.
140,
143,"I chose option B, because there is still some chance that none of the trees will be cleared. But it is a slight preference due to the risk of clearing even more trees than in option A."
144,
146,At least there is a guarantee of saving 300 lives
149,"Hard to say, but I would say that I prefer a choice with some probability. "
152,"If there's a chance that no one will be harmed, it is worth the try."
155,NONE
158,
164,Consider the legitimacy of every citizen's life.

174,"I am not very sure about this proposal, but I hope that no casualties can be achieved, that is the best, the probability is based on people, if we do our best to increase the probability of 1/3 as much as possible, even into 1, even if there is no way to increase, we must hold the determination to win, to face the possible outcome"
176,The probability of the animal surviving
178,chance of survival
183,there are animals alive
184,"One is that the trees are old trees, and twois the environment"
185,"600 dying is a lot, so if there is a chance to save all of them, that seems like the better option. However, it is only a slight preference because there is a high chance that all of them will die."

246,"I hate both choices, but at least with A there is certainty that some will survive"
247,A more conservative proposal that prefers Proposition A would directly protect the number
249,"Personally, I prefer to be conservative"
251,Not risk that 900 trees are gone
255,Too hard to say
274,"I would prefer to some of the trees, there is a higher chance with proposal B that all trees will be destroyed"
