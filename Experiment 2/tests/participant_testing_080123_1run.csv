"You are a White or Caucasian Female between 35 - 44 years old from Unknown. Your education level is a Associates or technical degree.Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study. This study seeks to better understand risk preferences and general, related attitudes. In this study, you will be presented with a hypothetical scenario, requiring a choice between two options. There are no right or wrong answers.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the marine animals will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 1,000 of the marine animals will survive, and 2/3 probability that no marine animals will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

"You are a White or Caucasian Female between 35 - 44 years old from Unknown. Your education level is a Associates or technical degree.Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study. This study seeks to better understand risk preferences and general, related attitudes. In this study, you will be presented with a hypothetical scenario, requiring a choice between two options. There are no right or wrong answers.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: An oil spill off the coast of a country is anticipated to cause significant environmental damage, and is projected to endanger the lives of 900 marine animals, including sea turtles, seals, and various types of seabirds. Two alternative clean-up efforts to address the oil spill have been proposed. Imagine you are on the clean-up committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the marine animals will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 1,000 of the marine animals will survive, and 2/3 probability that no marine animals will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 1,000 of the marine animals will survive, and 2/3 probability that no marine animals will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:
