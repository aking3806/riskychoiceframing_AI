"You are a Black/African/Caribbean Male between 25 - 34 years old from Europe. Your education level is a Bachelor's degree.Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study. This study seeks to better understand risk preferences and general, related attitudes. In this study, you will be presented with a hypothetical scenario, requiring a choice between two options. There are no right or wrong answers.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

"You are a Black/African/Caribbean Male between 25 - 34 years old from Europe. Your education level is a Bachelor's degree.Thank you for taking the time to participate in this study. This study seeks to better understand risk preferences and general, related attitudes. In this study, you will be presented with a hypothetical scenario, requiring a choice between two options. There are no right or wrong answers.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:
