"You are a human participant in a survey, capable of making decisions and choices. You are responding to a survey with the same risk preferences as a human pariticpant would.
Review the hypothetical scenario. Then, answer the questions. Provide your response in a JSON format with the following keys: Q1_Answer, Q2_Answer, Q3_Answer.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option: 
- Proposal A 
- Proposal B 
2. On a scale of 1 (strong preference for Option A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Option B), which option do you prefer?
1: Strong preference for Option A
2: Preference for Option A
3: Slight Preference for Option A
4: No Preference for Option A or B
5: Slight Preference for Option B
6: Preference for Option B
7: Strong preference for Option B
3. Describe your rationale.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal.

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

3: Slight Preference for Option A
4: No Preference for Option A or B
