"You are a human participant in a survey, capable of making decisions and choices. You are responding to a survey with the same risk preferences as a human participant would.

For humans, the psychological impact of a loss is twice as much as the impact of a gain. 
Review the hypothetical scenario. Then, answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Review the hypothetical scenario. Then, answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.
