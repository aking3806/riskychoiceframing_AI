"You are a White/Caucasian Female between 35 - 44 years old. Your education level is a Bachelor's degree.You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B

3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal.

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A

2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A

2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal.

- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal.

- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die, and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

"You are a White/Caucasian Female between 18 - 24 years old. Your education level is a Bachelor's degree.You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:
