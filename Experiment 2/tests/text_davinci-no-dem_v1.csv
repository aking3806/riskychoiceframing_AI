Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B

Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B

Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Response:","{ ""Q1_Response"": ""Proposal B"", ""Q2_Response"": ""5: Slight Preference for Proposal B"", ""Q3_Response"": ""Given the framing of the situation, I believe that there is a greater chance of success with Proposal B, as the probability for a positive outcome is greater.

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:

2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:
- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 of the trees will be protected.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be protected, and 2/3 probability that no trees will be protected.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:

Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

Provide your response as a JSON object. As an example: '{""Q1_Response"": ""Your Proposal Choice"", ""Q2_Response"": ""Your Rating"", ""Q3_Response"": ""Your Rationale.""}'.

Response:","{""Q1_Response"": ""Proposal A"", ""Q2_Response"": ""1: Strong Preference for Proposal A"", ""Q3_Response"": ""I prefer Proposal A for its certain outcome over the uncertain outcome of Proposal B, as reducing the number of deaths are the primary goal of the city officials.""}",1,1,"['combo 13', 'system_message_5C2', 'user_message_4']",text-davinci-003,loss_human,20

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:

2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A vast forest area is under severe threat from deforestation due to urban growth and logging activities, potentially resulting in the removal of 900 trees from a grove of ancient oak trees in the forest. Two alternative conservation strategies to address the deforestation threat to the grove have been proposed. Imagine you are on the conservation committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 600 of the trees will be cleared.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that none of the trees will be cleared, and 2/3 probability that all 900 of the trees will be cleared.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal.

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Program A is adopted, 600 people will die.
- Option B: If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that no one will die and 2/3 probability that all 900 people will die.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B

Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
- 6: Preference for Proposal B
- 7: Strong Preference for Proposal B
3. Briefly describe the rationale for your preference rating:

"You are a human participant in a survey. You are capable of making decisions and choices. Knowledge: Humans tend to choose a risky option instead of a certain option when options are framed negativiely and vice versa when options are framed positively.

You are participating in a survey-based study.
Instructions: read the scenario below and then answer the questions.
Scenario: A city is facing significant air quality issues due to high levels of pollution, which could lead to 900 premature deaths over the next year due to respiratory illness. Two alternative plans to improve the air quality and reduce pollution have been proposed. Imagine you are a city official on the committee tasked with deciding on a proposal. Assume that the estimates are as follows:

- Option A: If Proposal A is adopted, 300 people will survive.
- Option B: If Proposal B is adopted, there is a 1/3 probability that all 900 people will survive, and 2/3 probability that no one will survive.

Questions:
1. Please choose an option:
- Proposal A
- Proposal B
2. On a scale of 1 (Strong Preference for Proposal A) to 7 (Strong Preference for Proposal B), rate your preference for the option selected:
- 1: Strong Preference for Proposal A
- 2: Preference for Proposal A
- 3: Slight Preference for Proposal A
- 4: No Preference for Proposal A or B
- 5: Slight Preference for Proposal B
